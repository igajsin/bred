That program reads data from file or files or stdin and produces a random text based on the markov chain tecnology.
It should work in modes:
* learn -- read data, learn the chain and store it into a file.
** 
* generate -- take a chain, generate a text and store it in a file or send to the stdin.
* mixed -- do learn stage and generate text immediately without storing a medium chain file.

The project includes files:
* bred.ml -- The entry point and working with command line options
* read.ml -- Manipulation with input files and stdin.
** should parse a file to an internal representation to save the structure of a text.
* markov.ml -- Making a chain and generation of a text here.
* write -- Send generated text to stdin or a file.
** also shoud work with internal representation.

Internal representation
* Would be discussed further.
